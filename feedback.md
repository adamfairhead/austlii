We always welcome feedback about how we can improve AustLII (and particularly appreciate any words of encouragement). Although AustLII is a free service, we aim to run it on a professional basis.

**Before you send us feedback**, please check that your question has not been answered in the [Frequently Asked Questions](#) document, our comprehensive [Online Help](#) files, or perhaps in some other document available from the About AustLII page.

AustLII cannot provide legal advice. If you have a legal question, the answer to which is of sufficient importance to you, you should consult a qualified lawyer. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you might wish to approach your local community legal centre. [A comprehensive list of community legal centres may be found here.](#)
