## 1. Content, Databases and Markup

### 1.1) I have found a wrong (or acontextual) link!
This is the product of the massively automated "markup" software used by AustLII to insert hypertext links. The software is essentially heuristic in nature - that is, it makes 'intelligent guesses' and therefore also makes the occasional mistake, such as a link to the section of an incorrect Act where the context of the case does not make it clear which Act is referred to. Many of these mistakes relate to the nature of the English (and particularly legal) language. Unfortunately AustLII has neither the staff nor the funding to manually fix these incorrect links every time that the data is updated or reprocessed. We do, however, continue to improve the heuristics used by the markup software as resources permit.

### 1.2) I have found a broken link!
Broken links (ie links which produce a file not found message) can usually be fixed and should be reported to <a href="/austlii/feedback.html">AustLII Feedback</a>, with details of the URL of the page where the link is located and what you expected to find.

Note that we cannot fix broken links which are not located on our web site. If the broken link is on another web site, please contact that web site's maintainer and not AustLII.

### 1.3) How do you do the hypertext markup?
The software to mark up AustLII's databases was written by Andrew Mowbray. It is the result of a number of years of development. The heuristic rules that it embodies continue to be refined to deal with the nuances of the various databases available via AustLII. 

### 1.4) Why is the alphabetic list of cases wrong?
The alphabetic list of cases which is available from the opening pages of some databases is generated automatically from the cases in the database.  Unfortunately this may mean that the list of cases is not as useful as it might be, since case names provided by courts and tribunals can include first names and other details. AustLII is progressively attempting to normalise case names. See the HCA database for an example.

If you do not find a particular case name by browsing the alphabetic list: 

* use the [Case Name Search] facility from the Case Database Index page; or
* use the [Search AustLII page](http://www.austlii.edu.au/forms/search1.html)</a>, choose the "this case name" find option, and select the relevant case database(s) to search.

### 1.5) How do I find the XYZ Act or Regulation?

#### Using Autosearch
The simplest way to find an Act or a section an Act is to just type the name and or section reference into the search box on the AustLII opening page. Austsearch will detect this and will diplay a list of matching legislation from all jurisdictions.

#### Browsing
If you know the jurisdiction (ie Commnwealth, NSW etc) name of the Act or Regulation for which you are looking, the best approach may be to browse for it by clicking on the relevant jurisdiction from the [AustLII Databases page](databases.html), choosing the appropriate act or regulation database, and then selecting from the alphabetical list. 

#### Searching
If you do not know the jurisdiction (ie Commonwealth, NSW etc), but know the name of the Act or Regulation for which you are looking, go to the [Search AustLII page](http://www.austlii.edu.au/forms/search1.html)</a>,set your find type to [this legislation name](/cgi-bin/sinoform.pl?searchscope=Legislation+Name+Only) and select "All Legislation Databases" for the databases to search. If you do know the name of the jurisdiction, then select the appropriate database (eg "NSW: All Legislation").


### 1.6) How up to date is the XYZ database?
The simplest way to check database currency is via the "Update Status" links on the front page.

### 1.7) Does AustLII publish an authorised version of XYZ?
The reproduction of legal materials on AustLII is always with copyright and data permissions of the Courts or Legislatures. However, this permission should not be read as having granted 'authorised' status to the AustLII published version. 

### 1.8) When will materials from XYZ be added to AustLII?
To borrow from the world of information technology marketing, the answer is 'Real Soon Now'. We are always negotiating for the addition of new materials to the AustLII databases. There is a recognised advantage in the use of comprehensive sources when undertaking legal research, and we aim to make AustLII the most comprehensive resource for Australian legal research.

If you work for a court or tribunal that does not have its materials published on AustLII then we encourage you to contact us at [AustLII Feedback](feedback.html) to discuss arrangements. If you'd like to see a particular court or tribunal on AustLII then contact the court or tribunal and suggest to them that they publish on AustLII.

### 1.9) How do you choose the cases which will be reported?
AustLII does not choose which cases will be reported. For some Courts/Tribunals AustLII holds every case decided, for others we hold significant decisions (as selected by the Court), and in others we hold only reported cases. There are very few databases on any other service (electronic or paper based) which include all the decisions of a particular court.

If AustLII's coverage does not include a case you need, you may be able to get it at one of the commercial legal publishers' online subscriber services, your local public library or your nearest university law library.
