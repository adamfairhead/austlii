<h2 id="what">What does AustLII do?</h2>

<p>The <a href="/">Australasian Legal Information Institute</a> (AustLII) provides free internet access to Australasian legal materials. AustLII's broad public policy agenda is to <b>improve access to justice</b> through better access to information. To that end, we have become one of the largest sources of legal materials on the net, with over four million searchable documents.</p>

<p>AustLII publishes <strong>public legal information</strong> -- that is, primary legal materials (legislation, treaties and decisions of courts and tribunals); and secondary legal materials created by public bodies for purposes of public access (law reform and royal commission reports for example) and a substantial collection of law journals.</p>

<h2 id="help">Legal Information on AustLII</h2>

<p>AustLII maintains its own collections of <a href="/databases.html">primary materials</a>: legislation and court judgments ("case law"). Some legal training or familiarity with the subject matter is sometimes required to make use of these documents.</p>

<p>Alternatively, AustLII also has a collection of <a href="/databases.html#other">secondary materials</a>: commentaries and summaries on the law. This includes large projects such as the <a href="/au/special/indigenous/">Australian Indigenous Law Library</a>, the <a href="/au/special/lawreform/">Australiasian Law Reform Library</a>, the <a href="/au/journals/">Australasian Law Journals Library</a> and many others.</p>

<p>If you <b>have no legal training</b> but are trying to find out some legal information then consult the <a href="/links/2385.html">Community Legal Information</a> pages. Select the subject matter that you are interested in and click on the links until you find the information you're after.</p>

<p>Help on using AustLII is available. You can consult the comprehensive on-line <a href="/austlii/help/">help pages</a> for help on searching and locating information, or you can download and print the more extensive <a href="/austlii/guides/">AustLII User Guides</a>.</p>
