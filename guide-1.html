<p>The case law databases contain the decisions of judges in matters before a court or tribunal. In each decision the judge will go over the facts of the case, the relevant law in the circumstances, and then discuss how the law applies to the relevant facts. The judge may also refer to relevant legislation (laws or "acts" passed by parliament), regulations or international treaties. As a result, case law is often important in understanding how particular acts of parliament operate and apply day to day.</p>

<p>AustLII also publishes High Court transcripts. Transcripts of proceedings are verbatim accounts of statements given during the course of proceedings.</p>

<p>The AustLII case law databases include hypertext links to most relevant material. This generally includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>references to other cases;</li>
  <li>references to Acts; and</li>
  <li>references to sections in Acts.</li>
</ul>

<p>These links are inserted automatically by our hypertext markup software, which uses complex heuristics to determine exactly which documents a citation might refer to. In most cases the links are correct, however sometimes errors are made due to the nature of English writing, and legal writing in particular. You should also bear in mind that links to acts go to the current version of the act, not necessarily the version of the act that applied to the facts of the case.</p>
