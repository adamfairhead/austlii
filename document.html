<p><a name="Coversheettable"></a><a name="Headnote"></a><b>JUDGMENT</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><b>ROTHMAN
J: </b>Pursuant to a direction arising from the substantive judgment in this
matter, the parties apply to the Court for orders giving effect
to the said
judgment, the terms of which orders give rise to a difference between the
parties relating to costs and interest. This
judgment deals with that remaining
difference.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="2">The
substantive judgment (<i>Polias v Ryall</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2014/1692.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2014] NSWSC 1692)</a>, delivered on 28
November 2014, granted judgment for the plaintiff against each of the defendants
in relation to each of the defendants'
publications and the defamatory
imputations arising therefrom. The substantive reasons for judgment directed the
plaintiff to provide
Short Minutes of Order reflecting the reasons, from which
the difference between the parties arises.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="3">On
22 December 2014, having received a written outline from each of the parties,
the Court granted orders in relation to those matters
on which there was
consent, being orders 1 to 15 of the proposed orders provided by the plaintiff.
The Court reserved on proposed
orders 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the draft final
orders filed by the plaintiff. These reasons for judgment deal with those
reserved proposed
orders. These reasons for judgment should be read in the
context of the consent orders issued on 22 December 2014 and the reasons
for
judgment in the substantive judgment delivered on 28 November
2014.</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>Costs</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Two
issues arise in relation to the costs of the proceedings, being whether costs
should be assessed on an indemnity basis, or the
extent to which they should be
so assessed, and whether the liability for costs should be joint and several or
proportionate to the
damages awarded.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="5">The
plaintiff relies, for his claim for indemnity costs for the whole of the
proceedings, on <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 40</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</i> 2005</a>, which relevantly
provides:</li></ol><p></p>
<p>"<b>40 Costs in defamation proceedings</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>(1) In awarding costs in defamation proceedings, the court may have regard
to:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) the way in which the parties to the proceedings conducted their cases
(including any misuse of a party's superior financial position
to hinder the
early resolution of the proceedings), and</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) any other matters that the court considers relevant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(2) Without limiting subsection (1), a court must (unless the interests of
justice require otherwise):</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) if defamation proceedings are successfully brought by a plaintiff and
costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the plaintiff-order
costs of and
incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court
is satisfied that the defendant unreasonably
failed to make a settlement offer
or agree to a settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff, or</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) if defamation proceedings are unsuccessfully brought by a plaintiff and
costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the defendant-order
costs of and
incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court
is satisfied that the plaintiff unreasonably
failed to accept a settlement offer
made by the defendant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(3) In this section:</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>settlement offer</i> means any offer to settle the proceedings made before
the proceedings are determined, and includes an offer to make amends (whether
made before or after the proceedings are commenced), that was a reasonable offer
at the time it was made."</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li value="6">The
plaintiff submits that each of the defendants unreasonably failed to make a
settlement offer and each of the defendants unreasonably
failed to agree to a
settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff. It is necessary to set out or
summarise some correspondence between
the parties.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="7">On
28 November 2012 or 6 March 2013, the plaintiff, through his solicitors, sent a
letter to each of the defendants in relevantly
identical terms being, in effect,
a "concerns notice" purportedly issued under the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a></i>. This
correspondence "demanded", inter alia, an offer of compensation and was not the
subject of response by any of the defendants.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="8">On
30 January 2014, the plaintiff, through his solicitors, sent to each of the
defendants a letter containing an offer to settle the
proceedings. Again, the
letter to each defendant is not relevantly different and purports to be a
Calderbank offer. Once more, there
was no relevant response to this
correspondence.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="9">On
5 February 2014, the plaintiff served a notice of offer of compromise on each
defendant in accordance with the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/ucpr2005305/" class="autolink_findacts">Uniform Civil Procedure Rules</i> 2005</a>. The
terms of the offer of compromise had been served earlier by previously retained
solicitors who had mistakenly filed the said
offers of compromise. In earlier
interlocutory proceedings, another judge of this Court directed that the said
offers be removed
from the file (which occurred) and the currently retained
solicitors for the plaintiff, as a matter of abundant caution and lest
the
earlier offers be considered invalid as a consequence of the filing, served the
offers again on 5 February 2014.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="10">Each
of the offers of compromise proposed a settlement with each defendant that was
less than the damages awarded against such defendant.
As a consequence, the
provisions of UCPR r 42.14 apply.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="11">As
an alternative to his primary submission for indemnity costs under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 40</a> of
the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a></i>, the plaintiff seeks indemnity costs at least from 6
February 2014. Plainly, the offer of compromise of 5 February 2014 was, pursuant
to the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a></i>, a<i> </i>"settlement offer" giving rise to the
operation of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/s40.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 40</a> thereof. The earlier correspondence may also satisfy the
definition, but it is unnecessary to determine that question. </li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="12">Once
the Court is satisfied that a defendant unreasonably failed to agree to a
settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff, the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/da200599/" class="autolink_findacts">Defamation Act</a></i> provides
that, in the ordinary circumstances, any order for costs to the plaintiff will
be an order for costs of and incidental to
the proceedings, assessed on an
indemnity basis. The amounts, and any other condition, contained in the offers
of compromise were
more than reasonable.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="13">In
relation to the primary imputation that the plaintiff had stolen $2000 in Las
Vegas, none of the defendants were prepared, in evidence,
to allege that the
plaintiff had a state of mind consistent with the money having been stolen. Each
of the defendants imputed, by
their publication, such theft. Only the first
defendant was present in Las Vegas during the events in question. Each defendant
must
have known that he or she could not prove the truth of the allegation. In
those circumstances, it was unreasonable of each defendant
to refuse the offer
of compromise of 5 February 2014.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="14">As
a consequence of the foregoing, I see no reason why the plaintiff's costs of the
proceedings, to the extent payable by the defendants,
should not be assessed on
an indemnity basis. Such an order does not affect the continuing efficaciousness
of any prior order that
the plaintiff pay any or all of the defendants' costs
for any aspect of the proceedings.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="15">The
other matters raised by the defendants in response to the claim for indemnity
costs relate to the reasonableness of any charge
and the possible necessity to
repeat work due to the plaintiff's change of solicitors. These are matters for
assessment and do not
affect my view as to the appropriate order to
issue.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="16">The
second aspect relating to costs is the degree to which each of the defendants
will be liable for the costs of the plaintiff. The
course of these proceedings
was a little unusual. Ordinarily, defamation proceedings against multiple
defendants relate to one publication
and liability is joint and several. In the
ordinary circumstance, if there were multiple publications, there would be
multiple proceedings.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="17">In
the current proceedings, the plaintiff has sued four defendants for four or more
separate publications. If the plaintiff were to
have chosen the ordinary course,
assuming, as I must, that the result of the proceedings would have been
identical, each defendant
would be liable for the plaintiff's costs in each
respective proceeding. The evidence in each such proceeding would have been
identical
or substantially identical as the evidence in these
proceedings.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="18">The
course chosen by the plaintiff has, in effect, saved the defendants, as a group,
the costs of three sets of proceedings. There
is no good reason why each of the
defendants should not be liable, in full, jointly and severally with the other
defendants for the
plaintiff's costs of these proceedings.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="19">The
only differences that would be occasioned by making an order of the kind that
the defendants seek is the extent to which such
an order would resolve, as
between the defendants, their respective liabilities and if, contrary to
expectation, one of the defendants
were unable to satisfy his or her liability
for an appropriate proportion of the plaintiff's costs. No good reason exists
for the
plaintiff to receive other than the full reimbursement of his costs in
accordance with the orders of the Court.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="20">Nevertheless,
the Court should, subject to the plaintiff receiving the cost to which he is
entitled, obviate any disagreement as between
the defendants and the Court will
make orders determining the proportionate liability of the defendants as between
themselves, but
not in such a way as to affect the entitlement of the plaintiff.
The proportion which each should pay (subject to the overriding
entitlement of
the plaintiff to receive his entire entitlement) will be in accordance with the
proportion of damages, as suggested.</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>Interest</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li value="21">The
orders made by consent on 22 December 2014 included orders for the payment of
interest from the date of publication until the
date of judgment. After
judgment, interest is payable pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101</a> of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Procedure
Act</i> 2005</a> and the UCPR. The only issue between the parties in relation to
interest is whether interest should be payable on costs. With the
consent of the
parties, pre-judgment interest has been awarded at 3%.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="22">The
relevant principles applicable to a claim for interest on costs were stated by
Brereton J in<i> Grace v Grace (No 9)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2014/1239.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2014] NSWSC 1239.</a> His Honour
said:</li></ol><p></p>
<p>"[57] In <i>Drummond and Rosen</i>, Macfarlan JA, with whom Tobias JA agreed,
said that it was not necessary for there to be evidence of the date or dates on
which
the costs concerned were paid, if an order for interest under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(4)</a>
were to be made, and that in the usual case the court did not need to know when
the costs were paid (at [3]):</p>
<p></p>
<p>'[3] The matter in relation to which I respectfully disagree with his Honour
is as to the making of an order for payment of interest
on costs. His Honour has
quoted the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(4)</a> and (5) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Procedure Act 2005</a>. In my view
it is unnecessary for there to be evidence of the date or dates on which the
costs concerned were paid for an order for
the payment of interest to be made
under subsection (4). Indeed, such evidence would often not be particularly
useful. If the Court
does not choose to order that interest be payable from a
later date, interest will run, if an order is made under subsection (4),
from
the date or dates on which the costs concerned were paid. If the costs were paid
promptly, interest will run from an earlier
date than that from which it would
run if there was delay in payment. That is an appropriate result as the purpose
of an order for
payment of interest is essentially compensatory. I do not see
why in the usual case the Court needs to know when the costs were paid.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>[58] His Honour added (at [4]):</p>
<p>'In the absence of any countervailing discretionary factor (of which there
appear to be none in the present case), it is appropriate
that an order for
interest on costs be made to compensate the party having the benefit of a costs
order for being out of pocket in
respect of relevant costs which it has paid
[<i>Lahoud v Lahoud</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2006/126.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] NSWSC 126</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2006/126.html#para82" class="autolink_findcases">[82-3]</a> per Campbell J].'</p>
<p></p>
<p>[59] The defendants submit, however, that there must be evidence that costs
were in fact paid, and, at least in this case, when they
were paid in what
amount and by whom, as otherwise the court would impose a liability for interest
without any evidentiary basis.
The defendants invoke <i>Illawarra Hotel Company
Pty Ltd v Walton Construction Pty Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2013/211.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2013] NSWCA 211</a> ; (2013) NSWLR
436, in particular:</p>
<p>'[36] Illawarra nevertheless recognises that the power to award interest on
costs is discretionary and that some positive case must
be made in support of
the application. It says, in that regard, that Illawarra has paid out a very
large sum since the commencement
of the litigation in 2008 and that that money
could otherwise have been put to profitable use. Reference is made to an
affidavit
of Illawarra's solicitor referring to sums paid by Illawarra to his
firm. Illawarra further says that Walton has effectively had
the benefit of not
having paid that money.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[37] Walton submits that the question of interest on costs cannot be
determined without an exhaustive consideration of the circumstances
that caused
the proceedings to be protracted by the serving of evidence on unsuccessful
issues, futile amendments to pleadings, issues
not pursued at trial and matters
relevant to McDougall J's observation concerning "the evident animosity between
the parties and
the lengths to which each has gone to buttress its case".</p>
<p></p>
<p>[38] That submission must be accepted. A party who contends that there should
be an order for interest on costs must do more than
point to the fact that the
proceedings were protracted and that it had to outlay moneys on its own costs
over a long period. The
reasons for the protracted nature of the proceedings are
of obvious relevance. To take a hypothetical example, one can imagine a
case in
which one party deliberately seeks to prolong proceedings with an eye to some
collateral benefit of its own for which it
is quite happy to pay the price of
being out of the money it progressively outlays for costs. That hypothetical
case can be contrasted
with another in which a party has made strenuous effort
to expedite matters and to avoid all delay with a view to the earliest possible
trial but has been frustrated in those efforts by actions of the other party. A
middle course is where each party acts with reasonable
diligence and dispatch
but the nature of the proceedings and their subject matter is such as to prolong
them. A court might well
take different attitudes to applications for interest
on costs in these hypothetical cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[39] This litigation was, of its nature, time-consuming and exacting.
Building cases often descend into what, to the outside observer,
seems to be
tedious analysis of a vast myriad of minutiae. In the absence of some
sufficiently clear explanation of the reasons why
this litigation proceeded as
it did, in a timing sense, there would be no sound basis for exercise of the
discretion concerning interest
on costs, even if it were now exercisable by this
Court in relation to the costs in the court below.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>[60] In <i>Illawarra Hotel</i>, the court did not refer to Drummond and
Rosen. The apparent conflict between Drummond and Rosen and Illawarra Hotel has
been noted,
but not resolved, in <i>Zepinic v Chateau Constructions (Aust) Ltd
(No 2)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2014/99.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2014] NSWCA 99</a>, [43], [44]; <i>DSG Holdings Australia Pty Ltd v
Helenic Pty Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2014/142.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2014] NSWCA 142</a>, [5], [6]; and <i>Doppstadt
Australia Pty Ltd v Lovick &amp; Son Developments Pty Ltd</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2014/158.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2014] NSWCA 158</a>,
[404], where Gleeson JA said:</p>
<p></p>
<p>'[403] No issue was raised on appeal as to the principles applied by the
primary judge at [49] Judgment No 3. The payment of interest
is intended to be
compensatory, on the basis that the person entitled to costs has been wrongly
required to spend money on litigation
to enforce established rights: <i>Robb
Evans of Robb Evans &amp; Associates v European Bank Ltd (No 2) </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2009/170.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] NSWCA
170</a> as [44] per Basten JA (Campbell JA agreeing). Thus in the absence of any
countervailing discretionary factor, it is appropriate that
an order for
interest on costs be made to compensate the party having the benefit of a costs
order for being out of pocket in respect
of relevant costs which it had paid.
There is no requirement to establish that the circumstances of the case are out
of the ordinary:
<i>Drummond and Rosen Pty Ltd v Easey (No 2)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2009/331.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2009] NSWCA
331</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2009/331.html#para4" class="autolink_findcases">[4]</a> per Macfarlan JA (Tobias JA agreeing) citing <i>Lahoud v Lahoud</i>
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2006/126.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] NSWCA 126</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2006/126.html#para82" class="autolink_findcases">[82]</a>- <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2006/126.html#para83" class="autolink_findcases">[83]</a> per Campbell J.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[404] In this case, there was evidence before the primary judge by way of
affidavit from Mrs Vicki Lovick, the administration officer
of the respondents,
of the amounts paid, and the dates of payment of legal costs totalling
$636,558.27 as at 21 June 2012 (Black
936M). Thus no issue arises on the present
appeal as to whether a special order for interest on costs can and should be
made in the
absence of such evidence: <i>Drummond and Rosen Pty Ltd v Easey (No
2) </i>at [3] per Macfarlan JA (Tobias JA agreeing); contra Handley AJA at [49];
cf <i>Illawarra Hotel Co Pty Ltd v Walton Construction Pty Ltd (No 2)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2013/211.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2013]
NSWCA 211</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=84%20NSWLR%20436" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">84 NSWLR 436</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2013/211.html#para36" class="autolink_findcases">[36]</a> per Meagher, Barrett and Ward JJA.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>[61] In <i>Owners - Strata Plan No 61162 v Lipman</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2014/622.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2014] NSWSC 622</a>,
McDougall J did not think it open to deal with the matter on the basis that
there was no binding authority and concluded that he
was bound by Illawarra
Hotel, although his Honour observed that if the matter were to be decided on the
basis articulated by Macfarlan
JA in <i>Drummond and Rosen</i> (and, his Honour
added, similar views had been expressed on numerous prior occasions), the
particular case was one in which it would
still have been appropriate for there
to be some explanation of what appeared to be extraordinary delay (at
[266]-[270]).</p>
<p></p>
<p>[62] Unlike McDougall J, I do not consider that I should regard myself as
bound by the decision in <i>Illawarra Hotel</i>. First, the Court of Appeal's
observations on this issue were obiter, the ratio of the decision being (at
[33]-[34]) that interest
on costs was not part of the appeal. Secondly, their
persuasive force as obiter is diminished by the circumstance that they conflict
with an earlier decision of the Court of Appeal which has been applied on many
occasions, never expressly overruled, and not referred
to in <i>Illawarra
Hotel</i>. Thirdly, the Court of Appeal has had at least three opportunities to
resolve the issue but has deliberately left it open. Fourthly,
the observations
of Gleeson JA in <i>Doppstadt Australia Pty Ltd v Lovick</i> (at [403]), which
post-date the judgment of McDougall J, tend to support the approach of Macfarlan
JA in Drummond and Rosen. Fifthly,
as White J has observed, the Court of
Appeal's observations in <i>Illawarra Hotel</i> were made in the context that no
application for interest had been made to the primary judge [<i>Wardy v
Wardy</i>, [10]].</p>
<p></p>
<p>[63] The view that evidence that costs have been paid, and/or when they were
paid, is not a necessary precondition of an interest
on costs order, is
supported by a number of considerations. The first is the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(5)</a>,
which provides that if the court makes an order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(4)</a>, then interest is
payable at the prescribed rate from the date or dates on which the costs
concerned were paid (unless the court
specifies some other rate and/or some
other date). This provides a default position, which renders it completely
unnecessary to prove
when the costs were paid, until it comes to working out the
quantum of the interest. If an order is made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(4)</a>, then absent some
special order under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(5)</a> the costs will attract interest only to the extent
that they have been paid, and from when they were paid. A party seeking to have
interest run from a later date might need to adduce evidence to show why that
should be so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[64] The second is the history, referred to above, which shows that the
origin of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(5)</a> was in the power to "otherwise order" so that the default
rules about interest would not apply; coupled with the compensatory purpose
of
the power conferred by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(4).</a> It is now clearly established that, while
neither the incipitur nor the allocatur rule may do perfect justice in every
case, the
incipitur rule is to be preferred as the default position (while the
power to "otherwise order" enables the court to respond to the
particular
requirements of justice in the individual case [<i>Tarlinton; Hunt v R M
Douglas; Fischer v David Syme; Minister v Carson</i>]. The essential reason for
this is one of fairness, because otherwise, the sum of money that represents the
costs is "fructifying
in the wrong pocket" [<i>Newton v Grand Junction Railway
Co</i> <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1846/1049.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[1846] EngR 1049</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281846%29%2016%20M%20%26%20W%20139" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1846) 16 M&amp;W 139</a> at 141; <i>Tarlinton</i>, 7-8; <i>Minister v
Carson</i>, 352G-353F, 359D-361C]. Evidence is not required to make good the
proposition that the money is fructifying in the wrong pocket after
the
plaintiff has paid costs which it is later determined should be recoverable from
the defendant. Nor is the force of the proposition
reduced by the protraction of
the proceedings, or the reasons for which they are protracted. There is no
requirement to demonstrate
special circumstances in order to obtain an interest
on costs order [<i>Gilfillan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission
(No 2)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2013/143.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2013] NSWCA 143</a> ;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282013%29%2094%20ACSR%20543" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2013) 94 ACSR 543</a>, 549 [33]; <i>Lahoud v Lahoud;
Simmons v Colly Cotton Marketing Pty Ltd</i>, [14]]; and there is no need to
explain why the proceedings have taken the course they have, at least unless and
until some "countervailing
discretionary consideration" is raised.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[65] The third is that, because of the terms of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(5)</a>, an interest on
costs order has inbuilt safeguards. The default provisions of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 101(5)</a>, as well
as the usual form of order modelled on <i>Lahoud v Lahoud</i>, reflects the
compensatory nature of the power, and allows recovery of interest only to the
extent that (1) the court has determined
that costs should be paid; (2) an
assessor has allowed those costs; and (3) for the period from when the costs
were paid by the party
entitled. In view of those provisions, a court does not
need to know whether the costs have been paid, or when they were paid. Thus
the
defendants' submission, that without evidence the court would be imposing a
liability with no evidentiary basis for it, is incorrect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[66] For those reasons, in my view, conformably with what Macfarlan JA said
in <i>Drummond and Rosen</i>, a party who obtains a costs order will ordinarily
- in the absence of any countervailing discretionary factor - also obtain an
order
for interest on those costs, if it seeks one, and evidence of payment of
the costs is not required; nor is evidence explaining the
course of the
proceedings [see also <i>Lahoud v Lahoud</i>, [82]-[83] (Campbell J); <i>Hexiva
Pty Ltd v Lederer (Costs)</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2006/1259.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2006] NSWSC 1259</a>, [21]; <i>Wood v Inglis</i>
 <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2010/749.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2010] NSWSC 749</a>, [9]-[13]; <i>Lucantonio v Kleinert</i>, [25]].</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Discretionary considerations</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>[67] The foregoing discussion about the supposed requirement for evidence
largely also addresses the argument that an order for interest
on costs should
be refused on discretionary grounds. Interest on costs, like prejudgment
interest, is compensatory, not punitive.
It compensates the party entitled for
being out of money for the time it was held out of that money, and deprives the
party liable
of the benefit of having held the funds when it ought not have done
so: absent such an order, the sum of money in question fructifies
in the wrong
pocket. In the absence of countervailing factors, it is ordinarily appropriate
that an order for interest on costs be
made, so as to compensate the party
entitled for being out of pocket in respect of the costs that party has paid
[<i>Drummond and Rosen</i>, [4]; <i>Gilfillan v ASIC</i>, [33]; <i>Simmons v
Colly Cotton</i>, [15]; <i>Lucantonio v Kleinert</i>, [25]; <i>Wood v
Inglis</i>, [9]-[14]; <i>Tomasetti v Brailey</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2012/399.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2012] NSWCA 399</a> ; (2012) 275
FLR 248, [164]; <i>Lahoud v Lahoud</i>, [83]].</p>
<p></p>
<p>[68] While the power to make an interest on costs order is discretionary and
interest may be declined if there are 'countervailing
factors', as with
prejudgment interest under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s100.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 100(1)</a>, the circumstances in which a claim for
interest can be refused are rare. The analogous position with respect to
pre-judgment interest
on debt or damages under CPA, <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s100.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 100(1)</a> was explained by
the Court of Appeal in <i>Falkner v Bourke</i>  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20574" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1990) 19 NSWLR 574</a> (at
576B):</p>
<p></p>
<p>'Early decisions in this Court, both under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/sca183/" class="autolink_findacts">Supreme Court Act</a> and the
District Court Act in regard to the awarding of interest, referred to the
discretionary aspect of the power granted by the
statutes. However, as cases
have accumulated it has become clear that the circumstances in which a claim for
interest can be refused
are rare. The general rule was recognised as long ago as
1983 in a decision of this Court, <i>Homeowners Insurance Pty Ltd v Job</i>
 <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281983%29%202%20ANZ%20Insurance%20Cases%2060%2d535" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(1983) 2 ANZ Ins Cas 60-535.</a> It was recognised there by Glass JA (at
78,105-78,106) that interest is almost invariably to be allowed when claimed and
the Court's
decision in that case went upon that basis, that being another case
where a District Court judge had refused an award of interest
for a supposedly
discretionary reason, which was not really available in relation to the exercise
of the statutory power. Although
sometimes a countervailing factor may be self
evident (as in <i>Owners - Strata Plan No 1162 v Lipman</i>), ordinarily the
party raising it will bear at least an evidentiary onus of raising and proving
it.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>[69] In particular, delay - and responsibility for delay - is usually
immaterial, because the money is still fructifying in the wrong
pocket
[<i>Tomasetti v Brailey</i>, [164]]. If a defendant could show that, during a
period of delay responsibility for which could be sheeted home to the plaintiff,
it was earning interest at a lower rate than the prescribed rate that it would
be required to pay the plaintiff, that might well
support the court making an
'otherwise order' by way of varying the rate of interest payable - but it would
not support making no
award of interest at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[70] The defendants submitted that as a matter of discretion interest should
be refused because the protraction of the proceedings
was attributable to the
plaintiffs, in that they served evidence on issues on which they were
unsuccessful, made amendments to pleadings
to raise issues on which they failed,
abandoned a number of issues at trial, and 'given the evident animosity between
the parties,
the lengths to which the plaintiff has gone to buttress his
case'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[71] There are three answers to this argument. The first is that allowance
has already been made for the plaintiff's failure on a
number of issues, and
pursuit of issues on which he was unsuccessful, and any excess of zeal in the
pursuit of his case, in the determination
that the defendants should pay only
62.5% of his costs [<i>Grace v Grace (No 4)</i>]. The second is that the
protraction of the proceedings had many causes - some associated with the
plaintiff, some with the defendants,
and some with the court - and was by no
means exclusively the responsibility of the plaintiff. The third is that even if
the protraction
of the proceedings was substantially the responsibility of the
plaintiff, that does not mean that the defendants should retain the
benefit of
the money fructifying in their pockets in the meantime. That is because interest
does no more than reflect the time value
of money, and that the party liable has
held the money and derived the benefit of it while the party entitled has been
out of pocket
in the meantime. Whatever the extent of the plaintiff's
responsibility for delay, the defendants enjoyed the benefit of the money
of
which the plaintiff was out of pocket in the interim. As explained above, the
plaintiff's responsibility for the delay does not
somehow make it just that the
defendants should retain that benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[72] As will usually be the case, the compensatory purpose of the power is
sufficient to warrant making an interest on costs order,
and there are no
sufficient countervailing factors."</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li value="23">With
respect, I adopt the analysis of Brereton J and his Honour's summary of the
principles. Two situations may arise in any order
for costs. First, pursuant to
the Bar Rules and the Rules of the Law Society and the practice of the legal
profession, unpaid fees
will be subject to interest accruing at the prescribed
Supreme Court rates. In that circumstance, an order by the Court to pay costs
will include interest on those costs that remain unpaid, because such interest
will be part of the costs billed to the client.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="24">Secondly,
a client, entitled to an order for costs, may have paid costs as and when a
memorandum of fees or costs was rendered. In
those circumstances, that client
will not be entitled to interest on the costs, unless an order is made by the
Court, even though
the client will have been out of pocket (and lost interest)
on the amounts involved.</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li value="25">Costs
are compensatory. They are not punitive. In those circumstances, it is
appropriate, as stated by Brereton J, that, in the ordinary
course, an order for
interest on costs paid should issue. Not to order interest on costs paid would,
in ordinary circumstances, irrationally
disadvantage the client who pays legal
fees in a timely manner and, thereby, discourage such payment and, ultimately,
indirectly
add to legal costs. The calculation of the interest on costs should
be at the rate prescribed by the UCPR and date from the payment
of the fees
until the costs order is satisfied.</li></ol><p></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li value="26">For
the foregoing reasons the Court will make further orders in addition to the
orders made on 22 December 2014. The Court makes the
following
orders:</li></ol><p></p>
<blockquote>
(1) Orders (16) and (17) issued on 22 December 2014 in this matter are
vacated;</blockquote><p></p>
<blockquote>
(2) Subject to any earlier order issued from this Court rendering the plaintiff
liable for the defendants' costs of any interlocutory
aspect of these
proceedings, the defendants shall pay the plaintiff's costs of and incidental to
these proceedings, as agreed or
assessed, on an indemnity basis. The liability
for said costs shall be joint and several, but, as between each of the
defendants,
each other defendant shall be liable to reimburse: the first
defendant for any amount paid by him over 36% of the costs as assessed
or
agreed; the second defendant for any amount paid by him over 39% of the costs as
assessed or agreed; the third defendant for any
amount paid by her over 15% of
the costs as assessed or agreed; and the fourth defendant for any amount paid by
him over 10% of the
costs as assessed or agreed;</blockquote><p></p>
<blockquote>
(3) Pursuant to <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/s101.html" class="autolink_findacts">section 101(4)</a> and (5) of the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa2005167/" class="autolink_findacts">Civil Procedure Act</i> 2005</a>,
interest is to be paid on the amount payable under order (2) above at the rate
prescribed by the<i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/ucpr2005305/" class="autolink_findacts">Uniform Civil Procedure Rules</i> 2005</a> from the date or
dates on which the costs concerned were paid by the plaintiff until payment by
the defendants of the amounts so
payable. For said purpose, the plaintiff is to
be taken to have paid the costs concerned on the date or dates of the payment or
payments
actually made by him for or on account of the costs of these
proceedings, but only to the extent of the proportion of each such payment
that
the total amount of costs allowed on assessment under the said order bears to
the total amount of costs which the plaintiff
has paid or is liable to pay as
between the practitioner and client in connection with these
proceedings.</blockquote><p></p>
